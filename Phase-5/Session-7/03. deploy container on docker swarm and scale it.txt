Deploy a docker container on a docker swarm
---------------------------------------------------

docker swarm: managing multiple containers running on different host.
 where we will initiate a swarm that node will become leader node and another can join to this node and you can use the as a worker node.

set the permission

> sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

step: 1 initialize a docker swarm
	> docker swarm init (machine will become leader node)
	> docker node ls (see the status of your node)
step: 2 create service in this docker swarm
	> docker service create -p 80:80 --name myservice myimage

	yoy can see the application running on port 80:--->publicip:80

>curl localhost:80

see the running service 
> docker service ls

*****************************************************************
scale Docker container on a docker swarm

> docker service ls
> docker service ps myservice (name of your service)

scale


> docker service scale myservice=3
> docker service ls
> docker service ps myservice
